NOTE!

This implementation is directly based on the pseudocode in the IETF
RFC 8439. The code components of IETF RFCs are licensed under BSD
license. The parts of this software that translations of IETF RFC 8439
pseudocode into Common Lisp are marked with docstring or comment text
"This code was derived from IETF RFC 8439. Please reproduce this note
if possible." The original IETF copyright is pasted once in each file
where such translated pseudocode parts appear just before first such
appearance.

Also the test vector values in tests/unit-tests.lisp are derived
directly from the IETF RFC 8439. These uses are marked with "These
test vector values were derived from IETF RFC 8439. Please reproduce
this note if possible."
